# SongWrite

Collaborative writing of both the lyrical and musical content of the song...in no particular order...whichever comes first!!!

Upload your lyrics, or create a new file and add the initial lyrics for your song if you have any.

When working on the lyrics, please follow the below steps:

1. Clone the original lyric document
2. Make your changes and/or additions
3. Save the updated lyrics with your own name and incrementally increase the version number.

Naming format is {NameOfYourSong}-{YourInitials}-{VersionNumber}

Fill out the comments section at the bottom of the "Commit" page before committing or uploading, outlining any changed made to the lyrics and why?
